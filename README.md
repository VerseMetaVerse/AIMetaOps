# AIMetaOps
A Kube powered infrastructure to feed MetaVerse deployables including DigitalTwins

# Introduction

- The Metaverse is positional. It has a representation of some sort that represents some entity in a manner that human senses are naturally attuned to
- For example a Digital Twin of a solar power plant could be a 3D representation that you can walk around
- Any particular MetaVerse infrastructure will need vast services in the running of the MetaVerse but they will be focused on provididing the platform
- The array of services and data feed to inform the model at a particular MetaVerse location such as a Digital Twin will be custom to that rpresentation
- Infratrructure based on Kubernetes, powered by Google's Go language will host the processing typically powered by "AI" that is scripted by Python and often deployed from Jupyter or Juypter-like Notebooks


#Objective

- The objective of this project is to standardize the above mini-infrastructure to a smaller subset of the vast array of available technogies to enable a practical POC for the VerseMetaVerse to come alive!
